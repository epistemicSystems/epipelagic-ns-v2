# AGENTS Guidelines

These instructions apply to all work in this repository.

1. Keep the repository aligned with the epipelagic turbulence research framework. New content should clarify agent roles, workflows, and implementation guidance rather than diverging into unrelated topics.
2. Maintain concise, action-oriented sections in documentation (e.g., bullet lists, checklists, or short paragraphs with clear headings). Prefer Markdown over other formats.
3. For any code or configuration that is added later, include brief comments explaining purpose, inputs, and expected outputs; default to Pythonic naming and avoid wrapping imports in try/except.
4. When writing PR summaries, include: (a) a short bullet list of the main changes, and (b) the tests or checks run (or explicitly state if none were run).
5. Favor reproducibility: specify commands, parameters, and file paths for experiments or prototypes so others can rerun them.
6. If you update existing text, preserve the established terminology for the three agents (Sonnet, Haiku, Code) and the research milestones.
